# Mamba  (OCR-Translator-Assistant)

## Overview

The first idea for this project was the OCR translator, using a custom logistic regression (softmax). The model reads handwritten characters, changes them to string format and then translates. This approach achieves an accuracy of 70%, with 26 labels, the uppercases, and 69.6% with 62 labels, uppercases, lowercases and numbers.

The next step has been the implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the predict model. The accuracy grows up until 85% for 62 labels and 94% for 26 labels.

With this model, the challenge was build a voice assistant, called Mamba.
